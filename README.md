This is my archive of files for the Tevo Tarantula Pro (green version). At the moment, printing on Prusa Slicer, but I'll add the previous Simplify3d profile I used to print with.

All my final releases will go into this repository, so be sure to keep checking back for updates - and I will be updating the Prusa Slicer files as I keep printing, testing and tweaking.

So that you don't have to risk making typos by manually typing out the start and end G-code, here are a pair of text files that you can just copy+paste straight into Pursa Slicer.
